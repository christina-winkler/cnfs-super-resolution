# Conditional Normalizing Flows for Super-Resolution

This repository contains an implementation in Pytorch of conditional normalizing flows applied to super-resolution.
This master thesis project was conducted at the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab 2019. 


This Code corresponds to the pre-print:
**[Likelihood Learning with Conditional Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00042)**.

Results of the conditional normalizing flow model compared to a factorized likelihood baseline:

### Requirements

The requirements for the conda environment in which we have tested this code are started in `environment_nfsr.yaml`.

The main dependencies are:
-   `python 3.8.3`
-   `pytorch 1.8.0` 

The conda environment can be installed via

``` bash
conda env create -f environment_nfsr.yaml 
```
	
And used by running

``` bash
source activate cnf-sr
```
